## Frontend Projects Challenge

This is the repository for my personal challenge: making 9 different projects frontend-related to get a better understanding about the making of web app through different libraries and frameworks.

The idea is based on [this](https://medium.com/better-programming/9-projects-you-can-do-to-become-a-front-end-master-in-2020-97577110cca1) article.

Technologies that I used or I get to know and familiarized with during the project:

- **Movie App**: ReactJS, Hooks
- **Chat App**: VueJS, Vuex, ChatKit
