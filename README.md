# frontend-projects-challenge

This is the repository for my personal challenge: making 9 different projects frontend-related to get a better understanding about the making of web app through different libraries and frameworks.

The idea is based on this article: https://medium.com/better-programming/9-projects-you-can-do-to-become-a-front-end-master-in-2020-97577110cca1
