This is a real-time chat application using Vue.js powered by ChatKit, a service provided by Pusher.

The app will do the following:

- Have multiple channels and rooms
- List room members and detect presence status
- Detect when other users start typing

For this application, only the frontend is built. The ChatKit service has a back-end interface that allows managing users, permissions and rooms.
